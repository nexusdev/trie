Everybody is familiar with trees. You can usually find them in forests, or
just alone standing somewhere. Overall they are really useful structures and
can help us with a lot of tasks. However, not many of us know what a trie is.
Trie stands short for retrieval, and is a data structure to store and search
things, based on their prefix. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) you
can learn more why they are useful data structures, here we will focus on their
implementation.
We will use our reporer again with a small helper tool called docgen. [get it here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mhhf-docgen) or
with `npm i -g mhhf-docgen`. This will render a markdown file to html and use
viz.js to render code blocks with dot notation.

Just run `dapple test --report && docgen report.md report.html` to reproduce the report.
